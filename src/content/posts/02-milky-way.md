## Work in Progress

This project is still unfolding. I'm currently experimenting with different gear setups, scouting dark-sky locations, and refining my post-processing workflow. As I continue learning and capturing new shots, I’ll be updating this post with fresh insights, tips, and photos. Stay tuned — the hunt for the perfect Milky Way shot is far from over.
