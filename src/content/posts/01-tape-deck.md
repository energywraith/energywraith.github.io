## Introduction

**The Sony MHC-3600** is a mini HI-FI system featuring an amplifier, tuner, CD player, and **tape deck**. This system, produced in 1991, has a bit of history‚Äîit's older than me!
My dad bought it second-hand long ago. While I don't remember how it sounded back then, I recently wanted to listen to some good music on cassette and discovered that all I could hear was **a ticking noise**.
I liked the beat, but I don't think it‚Äôs supposed to sound like that! Shouldn't I be hearing **"Forever Young"** by **Alphaville**? Upon closer inspection, I noticed the **cassette reels weren't moving...**

## Research - How Tape Deck creates the sound? üë®‚Äçüè´

We need to start with the basics, how **tapes** work?
Similarly to Vinyl, **tapes are analog**. It means, that we need a **complex mechanism** that will move the **magnetic tape**, and convert the signal to **electrical signals**.

**Playback Head** is what reads the encoded audio information from magnetic tape, it converts magnetic signals to electrical signals which are send to amplifier, and further to speakers.

**Supply reel** holds unused portion of the magnetic tape, as the deck plays the tape moves to **Take-Up reel** which collects the tape after it has passed through the playback mechanism.

**Capstan** and **Pinch Roller** ensures that the tape moves smoothly at consistent speed without slipping.

*Back of the mechanism - Sony MHC 3600*

After turning the mechanism around, we can see the **motor belt** and the **capstan belt**.
The **capstan belt** is not in place because it needs to be connected to the motor, which would then completely cover the mechanism.

**Motor belt** is responsible for setting the mechanism in motion.

**Capstan belt** is responsible for tape transport.

When doing research about **tape decks**, I noticed that they are often the source of problems with **playback**.
The reason for this is that **belts** are made of **rubber**, which tends to break with age, especially when the machine has not been used frequently.
The rubber gets loose or even turns into a sticky goo, preventing the **reels** from moving.

This will be the first thing we check on our **Sony MHC 3600**.

## Disassembly

First we need to open the case. **Unscrew** the **bolts** on the **sides**, and **slide off** top part of the case.

***Unpin** the connections, **unscrew** bolts on the **bottom** and **slide** the mechanism to the **front**.*

*According to service manual, we need to **squeeze** PCB connectors using **pair** of **pliers**.*

*We finally got to the **belts**!*

## Cleaning up

As you can see **belts** turned out to be **sticky goo**, we have to replace them. But before we do so, we need to clean the mess up!
First, we need to take the remains of old belt out. Next, its important to clean the **reels** and **capstan**.
What do we need? **Q-tips** and something **alcohol based**, I have used **nail polish remover**. Carefully take some of the cleaner on Q-tip
and start the brushing.

## Replacing belts

If you are repairing your gear along with me, and your belts look alright, but they are old I would still **recommend** to replace them.
As time goes **belts** tend to turn **loose**, which may cause **slipping** on reels, which may cause **problems** with playback.

*That belt fell apart in my hands!*

Before replacing we need to make sure that we have the **right size** of the **belts**. How? I **recommend** to look for belts made for your specific model.
There's a chance you will find them in online auction shops, like **Ebay**. I have found Sony MHC-3600 belts on **Allegro**. If you wont be able to find them, its best to get a **bag of belts with different sizes**.

[![Bag of belts](/tape-deck/bag-of-belts.webp)](/tape-deck/bag-of-belts.webp)
*Bag of belts I have ordered for a different project!*

Place the new capstan belt around the **capstan motor pulley** and the **flywheel**.
**Ensure** the belt is properly seated and not twisted.

Next, we need to **assemble** the parts together in the same way we disassembled them.
If you have problem with this step, there are a lot of videos on youtube about similar models, that can help you.

## Cleaning head

After we assemble everything, its a good idea to **clean the head**.

**Cleaning the head** is as **important** as having proper belts. It's important for **maintenance** because a **dirty head** may cause the **sound** to be **muffled**. This may not be the case now, but it's still worth making sure the head is clean, as it takes only a **moment**! If you have a **tape deck** or **Walkman** you would like to listen to, I **encourage** you to do it with me!

Use a **Q-tip** with **alcohol-based** liquid!

Also, make sure that **pinch roller**, and **capstan** are clear. If those elements are dirty, they can cause the deck to **eat tapes**!

## Forever Young

Is **Sony MHC-3600 Forever Young** after these fixes? Of course it is!
Although there is a problem with CD tray, which does not want to close sometimes, I hope I will soon find the time to fix it too, and that **you will me join me**!

Nonetheless, enjoy the sound of **good ol' cassette tape**! :)

## Vanture

Have you already seen my project **[Vanture](https://vanture.club)**? It is a web app that allows you to enter the **realm** of the **80s vibe**!
I warmly **invite** you to [check it out](https://vanture.club)! I couldn't resist and have played **Vanture radio** on that HI-FI system. **Take a look** at the **video** below!
